 CUSTOM CODE EXTENSIONS
------------------------
Extensions allow anyone to write custom code that integrates with the Ironmon Tracker script.
These extensions can be anything, from new features or improvements to existing features.
Developers can create and share their own extensions with ease.

To learn more, visit the wiki: https://github.com/besteon/Ironmon-Tracker/wiki/Tracker-Add-ons#custom-code-extensions

To add a custom extension to your Tracker:
- Simply place the extension's files inside the "extensions" folder found in your Tracker folder.
- Enable or disable extensions from within the Tracker by navigating to Settings -> Extensions.

To create your own custom extension:
- Take a look at the "CodeExtensionTemplate.lua.txt" file found in the "extensions" folder.
- This file is a template for what a custom code extension might look like.
- Other examples of working extensions can be found on the Tracker's wiki
